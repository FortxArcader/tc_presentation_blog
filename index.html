                <h2>The Past of Writing</h2>
                <h3>Early Writing Systems</h3>
                <p>The earliest known writing systems, such as cuneiform in Mesopotamia (~3200 BCE) and Egyptian hieroglyphs (~3100 BCE), were primarily used for record-keeping and religious purposes.</p>
                <h3>The Birth of Alphabets</h3>
                <p>The Phoenician alphabet (~1050 BCE) marked a turning point by introducing a phonetic system that represented sounds, paving the way for modern alphabets.</p>
                <h3>The Printing Press Revolution</h3>
                <p>Johannes Gutenberg’s printing press (1440 CE) democratized knowledge by making books widely available, catalyzing the spread of ideas across Europe during the Renaissance.</p>
